The project is the learning notes for the Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment
book. The project including all codes implement and solutions for exercise problems. The
organization of the project is following the book by chapter, so every chapter have a
directory under top directory. Maybe some other organization will appear in the future
because of learning arrangement. Because I start the project when I studied chapter2, so
there is no directory for chapter1.

For convenient to cooperation, I will illustrate some things about book and programs
organizations.

Firstly, my APUE book is the third edition, PDF file. You can Google it by apue book pdf,
easy to get, note that it's the third edition, PDF file. And I open the book by zathura
tool on Debian, so the actually page number in paper book is different from that zathura
give to me, but the example programs in book ,not exercises programs written and test by
me are named by page number, see README file in chapter2 folder. The page number for
naming example program in book is from zathura tool, not the actually page on that paper
book. If you don't use zathura or don't use Debian, does not matter, the first line of
every example program in chapter folder is the actually page number in the paper book. By
using page number for example programs naming, I am every convenience for reading and
working on this project, because I don't need to memorize what chapter or what section or
what small section I am reading for naming one example program, just page number, easy to
use. If you want to test these programs while reference APUE book, please careful this convention.

The include folder and lib folder are from author's source codes. The other programs are
from the author's book, but I rewrite and test it for learning and understanding aims. The
exercise folder do by myself.

In each chapter directory, there are two directories existing in any chapter directory,
one is example_programs, it is for put the example programs for testing and rewriting. The
other directory is exercise, for containing exercise problems at the end of each chapter.
