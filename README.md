The project is the learning notes for the Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment
book. The project including all codes implement and solutions for exercise problems. The
organization of the project is following the book by chapter, so every chapter have a
directory under top directory. Maybe some other organization will appear in the future
because of learning arrangement. Because I start the project when I studied chapter2, so
there is no directory for chapter1.
