This directory is about programs and exercises of chapter2. Every program is named like "pxx.c", 
where "p" is the shorthand of "page", and "xxx" is the number of page. This convention also 
apply to other chapter directories, so the convention statement will not appear in other directories.

Questions:
1. Are you reading apue2 or apue3? In my apue3, chapter 3 begins at p61. How can your p81.c be in chapter 2?
2. I suggest you reconsider the naming convention because p81 in different versions of apue could point to different contexts. For example, apart from PDF version, I believe there are also EPUB and mobi version of this book. How can you be sure p81 has the same contents in all these versions?

In my apue3, on page 60 there is an Exercise section which contains 3 quiz, 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3. So, if I were you, I'd name my solutions to these quiz to q2.1.c, q2.2.c, q2.3.c, or ex2.1.c, ex2.2.c, ex2.3.c respectively. I think this perhaps a bit better than p81.c since I can't find related info on page 81 in my apue3.

3. README_ch2.tex should be renamed to README.{txt,md,html,...}.
